##run_analysis.R
This file contains the script to create the tidy data set
and it also contains comments, because comments make it more readable.

For this script to work properly, please place all the test and train files, 
as well as features.txt and activity_labels.txt, in your working directory 
before executing this script.

Please see the detailed explanation of run_analysis.R procedures in CodeBook.md

##CodeBook.md
CodeBook describes the variables, the data, 
and all the transformations or work that must be performed to clean up the data (script in run_analysis.R)

##Tidy Data Set
The Tidy Data Set is in file called "tidydata.txt". 
To read the file into R, please use read.table() function.
The explanation of variable names in tidydata.txt is located in the CodeBook.md
